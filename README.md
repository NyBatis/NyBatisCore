NyBatis RDB Persistent Data Mapper Framework

This is a mutation Data Mapper Framework of MyBatis (IBatis).

I admire MyBatis so usage of framework is very similar with it.

But it is simple and have less dependency of xml configuration than MyBatis.

I think that it would be alternative plan to handle RDB with Java.

It only supports JAVA 8 now.
